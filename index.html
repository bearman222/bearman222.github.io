        <h1>Barron Eskind</h1>
        <p><em>Python Programmer,</em> Web Applications Developer</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/bearman222">See my GitHub</a>
        </p>
        <p>I am a python programmer and full-stack web developer.</p>
        <p>My love for computers and code began early in life with a playful challenge of loading my
            favorite computer game from an ancient 5.5" floppy disc. I was, of course, trying to
            load the DOS game, <em>Chuck Yeager, andvanced flight simulator.</em> My dad, who was in
            the air force at the time, taught me some commands and how to load the help files. I was
            mesmerized by the terminal's green flashing underscore. I was using an i386 computer
            made 6 years earlier, the same year I was born. </p>
        <p>Chuck Yeager came with a 1 inch thick printed game flight manual. Everything I needed to
            load the game, navigate the menu to select air-craft and mission, and procedures for
            take off and basic flight. I crashed a lot, the screen would blank white and the sad
            beep of the motherboard would chirp indicating you had crashed. I learned which keys
            adjusted flaps, throttle, and wheel brakes. Time was suspended for me when I was
            learning and when I was flying. </p>
        <p class="aside">The thrill of flying in a simulated aircraft:<br> <em>The cooling fans
                inside my i386 PC whirr like jet engines.<br> Vectors and polygons render in 'real
                time' on a green and black CRT monitor.<br> The horizon fills the screen through the
                cockpit HUD of my F-4 jet.<br> <strong class="pop">Ignition! Thrust!
                    Lift-off!</strong><br> I was in control of the most powerful machine
                imaginable-<br> Jet streams directed by keyboard input-<br> There were no safety
                nets, learn to fly or crash and burn! </em> </p>
        <p>My obsession with computational machines would be life long. </p>
