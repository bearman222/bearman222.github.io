        <h1>Barron Eskind</h1>
        <p><em>Python Programmer,</em> Web Applications Developer</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/bearman222">See my GitHub</a>
        </p>
        <p>I am a python programmer and full-stack web developer. My love for computers and code began early in life
            with a playful challenge of loading my favorite computer game from an ancient 5.5" floppy disc. I was, of
            course, trying to load the DOS game, <em>Chuck Yeager, flight simulator</em>. My dad, who was in the air
            force at the time, taught me my first few commands and how to load the help files. I was mesmerized by the
            terminal's green flashing underscore. I loved the one to one input of the command line. I was using an i386
            computer made 6 years earlier, the same year I was born.
        </p>
        <p>Chuck Yeager came with a 1 inch thick printed game flight manual. Everything I needed to load the game,
            navigate the menu to select air-craft and mission, and procedures for take off and basic flight. I crashed a
            lot, the screen would blank white and the sad beep of the motherboard would chirp indicating you had
            crashed. I learned which keys adjusted flaps, throttle, and wheel brakes. Time was suspended for me when I
            was learning and when I was flying.
        </p>
        <p>The thrill of flying in a simulated aircraft:
            I push it to render white vectors and polygons on a green screen.
            The runway strip stretches out in front of my f4-jet, ignition.
            The cooling fan of the i386 is whirring like a jet engine.
            <em>No seatbelts, no safety nets, learn to fly or crash and burn!</em>
        </p>
