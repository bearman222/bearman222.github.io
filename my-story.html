    <h2>Why I started learning code</h2>
    <p>My love for computers and code began early in life with a playful challenge of loading my
        favorite computer game from an ancient 5.5" floppy disc. I was, of course, trying to
        load the DOS game, <em>Chuck Yeager, andvanced flight simulator.</em> My dad, who served in the US armed forces
        at the time, taught me some commands and how to load the help files. I was
        mesmerized by the terminal's green flashing underscore. I was using an i386 computer
        made 6 years earlier, the same year I was born. </p>
    <p>Chuck Yeager came with a 1 inch thick printed game flight manual. Everything I needed to
        load the game, navigate the menu to select air-craft and mission, and procedures for
        take off and basic flight. I crashed a lot, the screen would blank white and the sad
        beep of the motherboard would chirp indicating you had crashed. I learned which keys
        adjusted flaps, throttle, and wheel brakes. Time was suspended for me when I was
        learning and when I was flying. </p>

        <br>Vectors and polygons render in 'real time' on a green and black CRT monitor.
        <br> The horizon fills the screen through the cockpit HUD of my F-4 jet.
        <br> <strong class="pop">Ignition! Thrust! Lift-off!</strong>
        <br> I was in control of the most powerful machine imaginable--
        <br> The thrust of the jet streams directed by <em>my keyboard!</em>
        <br> There were no safety nets, learn to fly or crash and burn!
