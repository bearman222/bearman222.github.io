    <h2>How I started coding</h2>
    <p>My love for computers and code began early in life with a playful challenge of loading my
        favorite computer game from an ancient 5.5" floppy disc. I was, of course, trying to
        load the DOS game, <em>Chuck Yeager, andvanced flight simulator.</em> My dad, who was in
        the air force at the time, taught me some commands and how to load the help files. I was
        mesmerized by the terminal's green flashing underscore. I was using an i386 computer
        made 6 years earlier, the same year I was born. </p>
    <p>Chuck Yeager came with a 1 inch thick printed game flight manual. Everything I needed to
        load the game, navigate the menu to select air-craft and mission, and procedures for
        take off and basic flight. I crashed a lot, the screen would blank white and the sad
        beep of the motherboard would chirp indicating you had crashed. I learned which keys
        adjusted flaps, throttle, and wheel brakes. Time was suspended for me when I was
        learning and when I was flying. </p>
    <p class="aside">The thrill of flying in a simulated aircraft:<br> <em>The cooling fans
            inside my i386 PC whirr like jet engines.<br> Vectors and polygons render in 'real
            time' on a green and black CRT monitor.<br> The horizon fills the screen through the
            cockpit HUD of my F-4 jet.<br> <strong class="pop">Ignition! Thrust!
                Lift-off!</strong><br> I was in control of the most powerful machine
            imaginable-<br> Jet streams directed by keyboard input-<br> There were no safety
            nets, learn to fly or crash and burn! </em> </p>
    <p>My obsession with computational machines would be life long. </p>
